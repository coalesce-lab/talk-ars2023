## Agenda

1. Core and weak ties
1. Collecting data on "weak ties"
    - nsum
    - alter elicitation
1. Preliminary results
    - Network sizes
    - Composition
    - Effects on opinions towards redistribution
1. From personal to society-wide networks





# Core and weak ties

## Core ties

```{r dunbar-circles-inner}
ggraph(
  g, 
  layout = "centrality", 
  centrality = match(V(g)$circle, rev(names(circles)), nomatch = 6) |>
    jitter()
) +
  draw_circle(use = "cent") +
  geom_edge_link0(color = "gray90") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = circle, alpha = !outer), 
                  color = "white", size = 5, shape = 21) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 20)
  ) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Dunbar's circles") +
  guides(
    alpha = FALSE
  )
```


::: {.notes}

Research usually focuses on the core because:

- Seemed more impactful for the ego
- Typically small number of alters -- convenient to collect data

:::




## Core ties provide

- Social support: material, economic, emotional
- Feeling of being loved
- Improve coping with daily challenges and getting ahead
- Improve physical and mental health and well-being



## Core networks

- Relatively low degree (avg. 3 - 4)
- Relationships are intimate and "strong"
- Relationships usually parallel to kinship
- Local in physical space (67% of core ties with 1 hr)
- High social closure (local clustering)
- Stable over time






## Acquaintance ties

```{r dunbar-circles-outer}
ggraph(
  g, 
  layout = "centrality", 
  centrality = match(V(g)$circle, rev(names(circles)), nomatch = 6) |>
    jitter()
) +
  draw_circle(use = "cent") +
  geom_edge_link0(color = "gray90") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = circle, alpha = outer | is_ego), 
                  color = "white", size = 5, shape = 21) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 20)
  ) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Dunbar's circles") +
  guides(
    alpha = FALSE
  )
```


## Acquaintance ties provide {.smaller}

- Access to novel information
  - Granovetter
- Complementary / emergency support [@fingerman_2009]
- Source of future friends [@sprecher_2022]
- Influence the core ties [@fingerman_2009; @sprecher_2022]
- Looking glass on society 
	- perceptions of political situations based local evaluations [@mondak.etal_1996]
	- Inequality perception [@schulz_etal_2022]
- Belonging and familiarity [@fingerman_2009]
- Sometimes preferred sources of social support [@moreton_etal_2023]

::: {.notes}

- @mondak.etal_1996 examine the way how people evaluate politics and the economy based on evaluating their households, neghborhoods and circles of social contacts
- @moreton_etal_2023 -- people sometimes prefer social support from weak ties to avoid being "in debt" to core ties, or not to burden close ties

:::

## Acquaintance ties (macro level)

- Social cohesion
	- Relational aspect of it, out of the other aspects
	- Fractures across or along the faultlines
	- Between or within other social divides
- Weak ties are key to resilience
	- Strong ties build local cohesion but also fragment society
	- Weak ties are key to macrosocial integration (Blau 1974)
	
	
	
## Acquaintanship networks

- understudied!
- Stereotype: these are "accidental ties"
	- Form at random (nearly)
	- Personal networks are alike
- Transient ties seem stable (Dunbar et al from Nature)


# Questions

- Network sizes of Acq and core
- Composition of Acq networks
- Overdispersion analysis 
- Social cohesion computationally


# Methods


## The approach

- Estimate **overall** properties of acquaintanship network using NSUM
    - Degree distribution
    - Cohesiveness across categorical boundaries
- Take **samples** of alters
    - Random samples based on names
    - Purposive samples based on social groups (positions and origins)


## The BRIDGES survey

- **Country**: Spain
- $N = 1500$
- **Age**: 18+
- **Mode**: CAPI interviews
- **Interview time**: ~ 30 minutes
- **Time**: October - December 2021




## Network Scale-Up Method (NSUM)

NSUM = Survey instrument + Statistical model

- Estimating personal network sizes^[@killworth.etal_1990]
- Estimating size(s) of hidden populations^[@killworth_estimation_1998; @killworth_social_1998]





## NSUM -- survey instrument

::: {.callout-tip}
## BRIDGES survey 

Now I will ask you about the people you know in **Spain in general**. I will ask about the people you know with certain characteristics. By knowing someone we understand that you know the first name of this person and you would recognize one another if you ran into them for example in the street, in a shop, or in another place. This includes both **close relationships** such as your partner, family, friends, neighbors, coworker or fellow students and **less close relationships**, such as for example people whom you have met in the associations to which you belong or who you know via other people. 

These people do not have to live near you, you can also be in contact with them through social media or by phone. You may like them or not. Please do not include deceased persons, people under 18 years old, nor yourself.

How many people **over the age of 18** do you know (by name and by sight) who have the following jobs, whether they are women or men?

## NSUM estimator

Aggregated Relational Data (ARD)

  - $y_{ik}$ -- number of persons from subpopulation $k$ "known" to $i$
  - $N_k$ -- known size of subpopulation $k$ (e.g. from census statistics)

$$\hat{d}_i = \frac{\sum_k y_{ik}}{\sum_k N_k}$$

# From personal to society-wide networks

## PATCHWORK project

- Five European countries, representing different social cohesion regimes (Dragolov et al., 2016; Green and Janmaat, 2011)
    - Sweden, Hungary, Poland, Switzerland, The Netherlands
- Categorical boundaries: Social class, ethnicity, religion, political orientation
- Combines cross-national survey with qualitative analysis, agent-based modeling and simulation
