## Personal network

```{r dunbar-circles}
circles <- c(
  "Support clique" = 5,
  "Sympathy group" = 15,
  "Affinity group" = 50,
  "Active network" = 150,
  "Acquaintances" = 500
)

alters <- factor(
  rep(names(circles), circles),
  levels = names(circles)
)
edb <- data.frame(
  ego = 1,
  alter = seq_along(alters) + 1
)

g <- graph_from_data_frame(edb, directed = FALSE)
V(g)$circle <- c(factor("Ego"), alters)
V(g)$is_ego <- V(g)$circle == "Ego"
V(g)$outer <- V(g)$circle %in% c("Affinity group", "Active network", "Acquaintances")
```

```{r dunbar-circles-graph}
ggraph(
  g, 
  layout = "centrality", 
  centrality = match(V(g)$circle, rev(names(circles)), nomatch = 6) |>
    jitter()
) +
  draw_circle(use = "cent") +

## Core ties

```{r dunbar-circles-inner}
ggraph(
  g, 
  layout = "centrality", 
  centrality = match(V(g)$circle, rev(names(circles)), nomatch = 6) |>
    jitter()
) +
  draw_circle(use = "cent") +
  geom_edge_link0(color = "gray90") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = circle, alpha = !outer), 
                  color = "white", size = 5, shape = 21) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 20)
  ) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Dunbar's circles") +
  guides(
    alpha = FALSE
  )
```


::: {.notes}

Research usually focuses on the core because:

- Seemed more impactful for the ego
- Typically small number of alters -- convenient to collect data

:::




## Core ties provide

- Social support: material, economic, emotional
- Feeling of being loved
- Improve coping with daily challenges and getting ahead
- Improve physical and mental health and well-being



## Core networks

- Relatively low degree
- Relationships are intimate and "strong"
- Relationships usually parallel to kinship
- Local in physical space (67% of core ties with 1 hr)
- High social closure (local clustering)
- Stable over time






## Acquaintance ties

```{r dunbar-circles-outer}
ggraph(
  g, 
  layout = "centrality", 
  centrality = match(V(g)$circle, rev(names(circles)), nomatch = 6) |>
    jitter()
) +
  draw_circle(use = "cent") +
  geom_edge_link0(color = "gray90") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = circle, alpha = outer | is_ego), 
                  color = "white", size = 5, shape = 21) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 20)
  ) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Dunbar's circles") +
  guides(
    alpha = FALSE
  )
```


## Acquaintance ties provide

- Access to novel information
  - Granovetter
- Complementary / emergency support
- Source of future friends
  - Members of inner circles
  - Sprecher
- Influence the core ties
	- Sprecher? Fingerman?
- Looking glass on society
	- Mondak, Mutz, Huckfield 2009
	- Inequality perception
	- False consensus -- an assumption in collective action and ABMs
- Belonging and familiarity
	- Fingerman
- Some social support
	- Moreton & Kelly & Sandstorm



## Acquaintance ties (macro level)

- Social cohesion
	- Relational aspect of it, out of the other aspects
	- Fractures across or along the faultlines
	- Between or within other social divides
- Weak ties are key to resilience
	- Strong ties build local cohesion but also fragment society
	- Weak ties are key to macrosocial integration (Blau 1974)
	
	
	
## Acquaintanship networks

- understudied!
- Stereotype: these are "accidental ties"
	- Form at random (nearly)
	- Personal networks are alike
- Transient ties seem stable (Dunbar et al from Nature)
