                   provide a principled way to model and simulate
                   features common in human social networks, such as
                   propensities for homophily and friend-of-a-friend
                   triad closure. We show that, without adjustment,
                   ERGMs preserve density as network size increases.
                   Density invariance is often not appropriate for
                   social networks. We suggest a simple modification
                   based on an offset which instead preserves the mean
                   degree and accommodates changes in network
                   composition asymptotically. We demonstrate that this
                   approach allows ERGMs to be applied to the important
                   situation of egocentrically sampled data. We analyze
                   data from the National Health and Social Life Survey

                   actors, who provide information about themselves and
                   anonymized information on their network neighbors. In
                   survey research, this is often the most practical,
                   and sometimes the only, way to observe certain
                   classes of networks, with the sexual networks that
                   underlie HIV transmission being the archetypal case.
                   Although methods exist for recovering some
                   descriptive network features, there is no rigorous
                   and practical statistical foundation for estimation
                   and inference for network models from such data. We
                   identify a subclass of exponential-family random
                   graph models (ERGMs) amenable to being estimated from
                   egocentrically sampled network data, and apply
                   pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimation to do so and to
                   rigorously quantify the uncertainty of the estimates.
                   For ERGMs parametrized to be invariant to network
                   size, we describe a computationally tractable
                   approach to this problem. We use this methodology to
                   help understand persistent racial disparities in HIV
                   prevalence in the US. We also discuss some
                   extensions, including how our framework may be
                   applied to triadic effects when data about ties among
                   the respondent’s neighbors are also collected.},

                   for surveying hard-to-reach populations, especially
                   in the public health domain. Adjusting for the
                   complex sampling mechanism of the RDS procedure is
                   challenging. We propose a new model for the RDS
                   mechanism motivated by a graph model, which we call
                   the Homophily Configuration Graph. Under this model,
                   we develop a new estimator for population proportions
                   that is robust to seed bias, differential activity,
                   differential recruitment and short recruitment
                   chains. We also connect it to existing RDS theory by
                   showing that, if the sample fraction is small, our
                   estimator limits to the popular Salganik-Heckathorn
                   estimator. We perform simulation studies on both
                   empirically observed networks and networks with known
                   statistical properties, suggesting that this new
                   estimator has less bias than currently recommended

                   known about the temporal evolution of transient
                   relationships, although these constitute a
                   substantial fraction of people’s communication
                   networks. Previous literature suggests that ratings
                   of relationship emotional intensity decay gradually
                   until the relationship ends. Using mobile phone data
                   from three countries (US, UK, and Italy), we
                   demonstrate that the volume of communication between
                   ego and its transient alters does not display such a
                   systematic decay, instead showing a lack of any
                   dominant trends. This means that the communication
                   volume of egos to groups of similar transient alters
                   is stable. We show that alters with longer lifetimes
                   in ego’s network receive more calls, with the
                   lifetime of the relationship being predictable from
                   call volume within the first few weeks of first
                   contact. This is observed across all three countries,
                   which include samples of egos at different life
                   stages. The relation between early call volume and
                   lifetime is consistent with the suggestion that
                   individuals initially engage with a new alter so as
                   to evaluate their potential as a tie in terms of
                   homophily.},

                   component, while if Σ i(i -2)λ. {$<$} 0, then
                   almost surely all components in such graphs are
                   small. We can apply these results to Gn,p,Gn.M, and
                   other well-known models of random graphs. There are
                   also applications related to the chromatic number of
                   sparse random graphs.},

                   Literature on Minimal Social Interactions},
  volume =        {17},
  abstract =      {When people face difficult life events, such as
                   cancer or bereavement, they fare better when they
                   receive support. These “experiencers” are likely
                   to seek and receive support from a wide range of
                   people, from close others to acquaintances. Indeed,
                   the social support literature has long acknowledged
                   the value of having a diverse support network.
                   Research suggests that experiencers often perceive
                   “weak ties” (i.e., acquaintances) as sources of
                   support, and that experiencers sometimes prefer to
                   get support from weak ties rather than strong ties.
                   Providing support can be challenging for all kinds of
                   supporters, however weak ties may be more likely than
                   strong ties to allow worries about their inability to
                   provide effective support to stop them from providing
                   any support at all, thus depriving experiencers of
                   opportunities for additional support. In this paper,
                   we focus on the fact that often the provision of
                   support occurs via a social interaction. We draw on
                   the social psychology literature on minimal social
                   interactions to suggest reasons why potential weak
                   tie supporters might doubt their ability to provide
                   effective support, and to generate advice to
                   encourage potential supporters to reach out. Finally,
                   we suggest future areas of research, with the
                   ultimate goal of helping to expand the support that
                   is available for people experiencing difficult life
                   events.},

                   Perceptions},
  volume =        {70},
  abstract =      {Across income groups and countries, individual
                   citizens perceive economic inequality spectacularly
                   wrong. These misperceptions have far-reaching
                   consequences, as it might be perceived inequality,
                   not actual inequality informing redistributive
                   preferences. The prevalence of this phenomenon is
                   independent of social class and welfare regime, which
                   suggests the existence of a common mechanism behind
                   public perceptions. The literature has identified
                   several stylised facts on how individual perceptions
                   respond to actual inequality and how these biases
                   vary systematically along the income distribution. We
                   propose a network-based explanation of perceived
                   inequality building on recent advances in random
                   geometric graph theory. The generating mechanism can
                   replicate all of aforementioned stylised facts
                   simultaneously. It also produces social networks that
                   exhibit salient features of real-world networks;
                   namely, they cannot be statistically distinguished
                   from small-world networks, testifying to the
                   robustness of our approach. Our results, therefore,
                   suggest that homophilic segregation is a promising
                   candidate to explain inequality perceptions with
                   strong implications for theories of consumption and
                   voting behaviour.},

                   People's Web of Relationships and Their Formation},
  volume =        {29},
  abstract =      {The multidisciplinary field of personal relationships
                   has focused primarily on strong ties (romantic
                   relationships, friendships, family relationships).
                   However, acquaintances (weak ties) are pervasive in
                   people's lives, contribute to well-being, influence
                   strong ties, and can become strong ties over time.
                   This review article synthesizes several areas of
                   literature about the role of acquaintances (weak
                   ties) in the web of relationships and about the
                   formation of acquaintanceships. The terms
                   acquaintances and weak ties are used interchangeably
                   in this article to refer to the type of relationship
                   that exists in the peripheral layers of social
                   networks. In the first section, I discuss the
                   literature on factors associated with the size of
                   people's acquaintance network, needs met by
                   acquaintances (compared to those of closer ties),
                   health and happiness benefits of interaction with
                   acquaintances, and the dark side of acquaintances
                   including having unwanted acquaintances. In the
                   second section, I discuss how acquaintanceships are
                   formed, and particularly the type that can develop
                   into a closer tie. This section summarizes research
                   from the literatures on friendship formation,
                   relationship initiation, attraction, and first
                   interactions of dyads at zero-acquaintance. I end the
                   article by identifying several research topics on
                   acquaintances that could be studied by the next
                   generation of scholars.},
